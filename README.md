# QEC

This repository contains a set of functions that allows manipulation of stabilizer codes. The file syndrome.py is the first version of the code, but it suffers memory errors for many qubits in the physical space. The file syndrome_v2.py is the second version of the code, and it solves this problem by saving chunks of errors in files. I did this work for my bachelor thesis in holographic quantum-error correcting codes at Universidad de Los Andes.
