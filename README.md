This repository contains the file syndrome.py, a set of functions that allows manipulation of stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes. I did this work for my bachelor thesis in holographic quantum-error correcting codes at Universidad de Los Andes. 

The file Stabilizer.exe is a simple GUI that uses some functions from syndrome.py. It can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19jtH90pR6EzjofhoRyELZDSB8jEwEINy?usp=sharing.
